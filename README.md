Rest, In Peace is a project by Ernest Wu and Syahrul Anuar surrounding the upcoming demolition of Peace Center at Rochor.

The work relies on a few libraries mainly Selfie Segmentation and React Webcam.

Just `yarn install` and `yarn dev` to start the project.

Also good to clone my forked repo of Automatic1111 Stable-Diffusion-UI.
